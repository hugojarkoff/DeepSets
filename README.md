# DeepSets notebook for MLClass.

This notebook is part of Emmanuel Rachelson (@erachelson) Machine Learning class assignment. It is an introduction to DeepSets, an NN architecture invariant by permutation of its inputs. We quickly develop a NN that learns to compute the sum of any set of MNIST Digits, based on PyTorch.
